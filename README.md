psypkg
======

Unpack, list and mount [Psychonauts](http://www.psychonauts.com/) .pkg archives. Only
the uncompressed version is currently supported, because I only have access to such
files with my Steam copy of Psychonauts.

Basic usage:

	psypkg.py list <archive>                 - list contens of .pkg archive
	psypkg.py unpack <archive>               - extract .pkg archive
	psypkg.py mount <archive> <mount-point>  - mount archive as read-only file system

The `mount` command depends on the [llfuse](https://code.google.com/p/python-llfuse/)
Python package. If it's not available the rest is still working.

This script is compatible with Python 2.7 and 3 (tested with 2.7.5 and 3.3.2).

File Format
-----------

I used [this](http://quickandeasysoftware.net/readmes/PsychonautsExplorerHelp/index.html?pkgfileformat.htm)
description of the file format to implement this script. Here follows a summary of the
file format.

There are many doubled file names in the `PsychonautsData2.pkg` file distributed with
Psychonauts for Steam. I guess the later file records are updates on the earlier ones?

For these file entries the second occurance will overwrite the first when unpacking.
When the archive is mounted as a file system name conflict resolution is a bit different.
In this case `~number` is added between the file name and the extension. `number` is the
first number that doesn't produce a confict.

**NOTE:** I'm not quite sure about the file names. It could very well be that they are
a bit buggy and not exactly the way they should be. For instance without special logic
to prevent this I would extract absolute paths for some reason (like `lipsync/thaj000ht.pba`),
and some names looks like they are missing a letter at the start (`uckerfish` -> `suckerfish`?
`quirrel` -> `Squirrel`?). Maybe someone can find out the problem in my code?
